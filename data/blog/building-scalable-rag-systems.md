# Building Scalable RAG Systems: Lessons from Production

*Published: January 15, 2024*

After six months of building and deploying a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system at Volvo, I've learned valuable lessons about scaling AI systems in production environments. Here are the key insights that made the difference between a prototype and a production-ready system.

## The Challenge

The initial challenge was clear: create a system that could answer technical questions about automotive documentation with high accuracy while maintaining sub-2-second response times. The documentation spanned over 50,000 pages across multiple languages and technical domains.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Retrieval Strategy
Instead of relying solely on semantic search, we implemented a hybrid approach combining:
- Dense vector search for semantic similarity
- Sparse retrieval for exact keyword matches
- Metadata filtering for domain-specific queries

This combination improved our recall by 23% while maintaining precision.

### 2. Chunking Strategy Matters
The way you chunk your documents significantly impacts retrieval quality. We experimented with:
- Fixed-size chunks (512 tokens)
- Semantic chunking based on document structure
- Overlapping chunks with sliding windows

Semantic chunking with 20% overlap provided the best balance of context preservation and retrieval accuracy.

### 3. Real-time Monitoring
Production AI systems need comprehensive monitoring. We tracked:
- Query latency percentiles
- Retrieval quality scores
- Model confidence distributions
- User satisfaction ratings

## Performance Optimizations

The system now handles 1,000+ queries per hour with 94% accuracy and 1.2-second average response time. Key optimizations included:

- Vector index optimization with HNSW
- Response caching for common queries
- Async processing for non-critical operations
- Connection pooling for database operations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with simple baselines** - Complex systems are built incrementally
2. **Monitor everything** - Production AI systems behave differently than prototypes
3. **User feedback is crucial** - Technical metrics don't always align with user satisfaction
4. **Plan for failure** - Graceful degradation is essential for production systems

The journey from prototype to production taught me that building AI systems is as much about engineering discipline as it is about model performance. The most sophisticated model is useless if it can't be deployed reliably.
