# Anomaly Detection in Time Series: A Satellite's Perspective

*Published: December 20, 2023*

Working on satellite telemetry anomaly detection has given me a unique perspective on time series analysis. Unlike traditional business metrics, satellite data presents challenges that require innovative approaches to anomaly detection.

## The Unique Challenges of Satellite Data

Satellite telemetry data is fundamentally different from typical time series:

1. **Multi-dimensional signals** - Each satellite transmits hundreds of parameters simultaneously
2. **Non-stationary patterns** - Orbital mechanics create predictable but complex patterns
3. **Sparse anomalies** - Critical failures are rare but catastrophic
4. **Real-time constraints** - Detection must happen within seconds, not minutes

## Our Approach: Ensemble Methods

After experimenting with various approaches, we settled on an ensemble method combining:

### 1. Statistical Methods
- Z-score analysis for parameter drift detection
- Seasonal decomposition for orbital pattern analysis
- Change point detection for sudden shifts

### 2. Machine Learning Models
- Isolation Forest for multivariate outliers
- LSTM autoencoders for sequence anomaly detection
- One-class SVM for boundary detection

### 3. Domain Knowledge Integration
- Physics-based constraints (conservation laws)
- Historical failure patterns
- Cross-parameter correlation analysis

## Results and Insights

The ensemble approach achieved:
- **98.5% detection rate** for critical anomalies
- **2.1% false positive rate** (industry standard is 5-10%)
- **Sub-second processing** for real-time alerts

## Key Learnings

1. **Domain expertise is irreplaceable** - No amount of data science can replace understanding the physics
2. **Ensemble methods work** - Combining multiple approaches consistently outperformed single models
3. **Feature engineering matters** - Creating derived features (ratios, differences, rolling statistics) was crucial
4. **Real-time constraints change everything** - Optimization for speed requires different architectural decisions

## The Human Element

Perhaps the most important lesson was the importance of human-in-the-loop systems. While our automated detection caught 98.5% of anomalies, the remaining 1.5% required expert analysis. Building systems that augment human expertise rather than replace it entirely proved to be the most effective approach.

The satellite's perspective taught me that anomaly detection isn't just about finding outliersâ€”it's about understanding the underlying system well enough to know what's truly anomalous.
